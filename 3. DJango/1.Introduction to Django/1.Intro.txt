problem solution for installing: 

1>sudo pip install virtualenv
        or for python3

        sudo pip3 install virtualenv
        and then in your dir

        mkdir ~/newproject

        cd ~/newproject

        Now, create a virtual environment within the project directory by typing

        virtualenv newenv
        To install packages into the isolated environment, you must activate it by typing:

        source newenv/bin/activate
        now install here with

        pip install django
        You can verify the installation by typing:

        django-admin --version
        To leave your virtual environment, you need to issue the deactivate command from anywhere on the system:

deactivate

2.pip install Django
and then just run the command for testing:

python manage.py runserver
